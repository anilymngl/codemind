title: Lean PRD: Iteration 01 - Enhanced Reasoned-Executor Core
iteration: 01
date: 2025-02-06
status: Draft
component_focus: Orchestration Layer
---

## 1. Iteration Goal & Feature Summary

* **Goal:** Consolidate and enhance the core reasoned-executor architecture to establish a robust, reliable foundation for AI-powered code assistance.
* **Features:** 
  - Unified orchestration layer with comprehensive retry logic
  - Standardized XML processing and validation
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 2. Technical Value & Architecture Alignment

* **Technical Value:** This iteration significantly improves system reliability by implementing robust error handling, standardized data processing, and comprehensive logging. It establishes a solid foundation for handling AI model interactions while maintaining transparency in the reasoning process.

* **Architecture Alignment:** The enhanced orchestrator directly supports our core principle of transparent, reliable AI processing. The unified architecture reduces complexity while improving maintainability and sets the stage for future advanced features.

## 3. Core Technical Components

* Unified Orchestrator (`mvp_orchestrator/enhanced_orchestrator.py`):
  - Merges existing orchestrator implementations
  - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Provides standardized error responses
  - Manages AI model interaction flow

* XML Processor (`gemini_integration/xml_processor.py`):
  - Validates AI model outputs
  - Implements consistent schema handling
  - Provides error recovery mechanisms
  - Extracts structured reasoning data

* API Clients (`gemini_integration/gemini_client.py`, `claude_integration/claude_client.py`):
  - Enhanced prompt templates
  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Response validation
  - Error handling optimization

* Response Types (`models/response_types.py`):
  - Structured response definitions
  - Type validation
  - Error type hierarchy
  - Utility functions

## 4. Implementation Stories

* As the orchestration layer, I need to handle temporary API failures gracefully so that user requests can be completed successfully despite intermittent issues.
* As the XML processor, I need to validate and parse AI model outputs so that downstream components receive well-structured, reliable data.
* As the API client, I need to manage rate limits and handle errors so that we maintain stable connections with AI services.

## 5. Technical Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Unified orchestrator successfully processes requests with 99.9% reliability
* [ ] Retry logic handles temporary failures with exponential backoff
* [ ] XML validation catches and handles malformed responses
* [ ] Error responses are standardized and informative
* [ ] Response time remains under 2 seconds for 95th percentile
* [ ] Logging provides comprehensive debugging information

## 6. Technical Exclusions

* Advanced visualization of reasoning process - Focus is on core functionality
* Multi-model orchestration beyond Gemini/Claude - Limited to current dual-model approach
* Persistent storage of results - Maintaining stateless operation for now
* Advanced security measures - Basic security only in this iteration

## 7. Technical Notes & Dependencies

* **Required APIs/Services:**
  - Gemini API: Rate limit 60 requests/minute
  - Claude API: Rate limit 50 requests/minute
* **Performance Requirements:**
  - Response time: < 2s (p95)
  - Error rate: < 1%
  - Uptime: 99.9%

## 8. Technical Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk: API Rate Limiting**
  - Mitigation: Implement token bucket algorithm and request queuing

* **Risk: XML Parsing Failures**
  - Mitigation: Implement fallback parsing strategies and structured error recovery

* **Risk: Response Time Degradation**
  - Mitigation: Optimize retry strategy and implement timeout handling

* **Risk: Data Loss During Processing**
  - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive logging and state tracking
